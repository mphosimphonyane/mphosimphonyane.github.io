					<P>My name is <i>Mphonyane</i> from St michael's High school.I am little-middle aged girl who love Nature, i am fed up of this artificial and momentary pleasure which we derive from the city .I would like to settle in some village where i would be able to enjoy nature.Nature can be a true friend and guide for man.Wordsworth the great lover of nature, has also acknowledged this fact in his poems. I am very anxious to go and enjoy the scenery of steep hls;greenery of the own valleys , cool breeze and other natural things.</P>
